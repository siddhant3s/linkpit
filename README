(*) Change the config.php according to your MYSQL configuration.
(*) Run the linkpit.sql on your mysql client. This creates tables, required for
Linkpit and also some sample data.
(*) Enable mod_rewrite on your server.
        On Ubuntu and similar debian distros, all you have to do is run
        the following command on terminal"
                sudo a2enmode rewrite
        and restart apache by
                sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

(*) Change the line about RewriteBase in .htaccess so that it points to your
sub-directory, incase Linkpit is not hosted on webserver's root.
